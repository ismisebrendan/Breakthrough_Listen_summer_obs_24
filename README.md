# Summer Dual Site Observations
Code for scheduling dual site observations from Birr and Onsala LOFAR stations.

It produces schedules in the iLiSA format and the RÃ‰ALTA format.

 ```scheduling_options.py``` has a problem with its output, it loops for too long. Not sure why.

## To do
- Add ability to automatically choose a flare star to observe.
- Bring ```scheduling_options.py``` up to date with ```scheduling.py```.
- Fix ```scheduling_options.py```
