# Summer Dual Site Observations
Code for scheduling dual site observations from Birr and Onsala LOFAR stations.

It produces schedules in the iLiSA format and the RÃ‰ALTA format.

Exoplanets are queried from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and filtered to only target exoplanets discoverd by TESS. The list of pulsars and their properties are pulled from the ATNF catalogue.

## Requirements
The scheduling script requires a number of python modules in order to successfully query the respective databases. They can all be installed using ```pip```.

Astroquery can be installed using
```
python -m pip install -U --pre astroquery
```

psrqpy is installed by
```
python -m pip install psrqpy
```

It also requires more common modules: ```numpy```, ```astropy```, ```matplotlib``` and ```datetime```.

## To do
- Add ability to automatically choose a flare star to observe.
